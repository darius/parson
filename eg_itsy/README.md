## Itsy is not C but can translate to it directly.

A trivial example language inspired by the design goals of Per
Vognsen's [Ion](https://github.com/pervognsen/bitwise/blob/master/notes/ion_motivation.md)
language, but this was slapped together mostly before seeing his
work. Also, I'm pretty unconcerned about familiarity to C people.

Not finished, and I dunno if it ever will be.
