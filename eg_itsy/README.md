## Itsy is not C but can translate to it directly.

An example language inspired by the design goals of Per Vognsen's
[Ion](https://github.com/pervognsen/bitwise/blob/master/notes/ion_motivation.md)
language, but the syntax was slapped together mostly before seeing his
work. (The operator precedences are taken from Ion, though.) Also, I'm
pretty unconcerned about familiarity to C people.

Not finished, and I dunno if it ever will be.
